## Project-wide references and actions
- Personas: `AI_first/docs/project_wide_docs/personas.md`.
- Templates: `AI_first/docs/templates/` (project plan, phase definition/action plan, stage action, review checklists, DoD).
- Project-wide actions: add under `AI_first/docs/project_wide_actions/` if needed (not included by default).

## Governance
- Follow `AI_first/docs/process.md` and personas in `AI_first/docs/project_wide_docs/personas.md`.
- Use templates under `AI_first/docs/templates/` for new project/phase/stage docs.
