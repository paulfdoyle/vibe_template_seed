# Phase 02 — Professional report & docs presentation

- **Objective:** Produce a more professional PM report layout and a clearer user docs hub.
- **Status:** Complete.
- **Completed:** 2025-12-22.
- **Scope:** In: PM.html structure, formatting, and link organization; user docs index/formatting guidance. Out: automated data ingestion.
- **Definition of completion:** Phase action plan and stage action exist with a concrete proposal and acceptance criteria.
- **Stages:**
  - Report refinement stage → `AI_first/projects/project_management/phases/phase02/actions/project_management_phase02_stage_report_refinement_action.md`
- **Dependencies:** `AI_first/ui/PM.html`, `AI_first/docs/user_docs/README.md`, `AI_first/docs/projectplan.md`, `AI_first/ui/bugmgmt_issues.html`.
- **Risks/assumptions:** Keep the report static and easy to update; avoid introducing external assets.
