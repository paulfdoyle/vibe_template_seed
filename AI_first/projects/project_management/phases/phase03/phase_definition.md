# Phase 03 — Consolidation under single directory

- **Objective:** Consolidate process, BugMgmt, and project management artifacts under `AI_first/` to simplify drop-in reuse.
- **Scope:** In: move project planning docs to `AI_first/projects/`, remove empty workspace directories, update paths/links, and validate rendering. Out: PM.html feature changes or new automation.
- **Definition of completion:** Stage action executed with assets consolidated under `AI_first/`, empty directories removed, and links updated; docs render without broken links.
- **Stages:**
  - Consolidation under single directory stage → `AI_first/projects/project_management/phases/phase03/actions/project_management_phase03_stage_consolidation_under_single_directory_action.md`
- **Dependencies:** `AI_first/docs/projectplan.md`, `AI_first/projects/project_management/`, `AI_first/ui/PM.html`, `AI_first/ui/project_project_management.html`, `AI_first/ui/docs/`.
- **Risks/assumptions:** Keep non-PM docs untouched; ensure references updated; avoid breaking BugMgmt UI.
- **Links:** `AI_first/docs/projectplan.md`, `AI_first/projects/project_management/project_summary_project_management.md`
