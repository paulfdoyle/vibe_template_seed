# Phase 03 Action Plan — Consolidation under single directory

- **Phase:** see `AI_first/projects/project_management/phases/phase03/phase_definition.md`.
- **Stage list:**
  - Consolidation under single directory stage → `AI_first/projects/project_management/phases/phase03/actions/project_management_phase03_stage_consolidation_under_single_directory_action.md`
- **Objective:** Consolidate all process/PM/BugMgmt artifacts under `AI_first/`, updating links and documentation for drop-in reuse.
- **Scope/files:** In: move planning docs to `AI_first/projects/`, remove empty workspace directories, update link paths, doc rendering checks. Out: PM.html feature changes or automation.
- **Dependencies:** `AI_first/docs/projectplan.md`, `AI_first/projects/project_management/`, `AI_first/ui/PM.html`, `AI_first/ui/project_project_management.html`, `AI_first/ui/docs/`.
- **Risks/assumptions:** Keep cross-project links intact; avoid breaking BugMgmt UI.
- **Persona actions:** Default Reviewer/Sponsor → Project/Process Manager → Developer → QA Lead → Docs Expert.
- **Validation:** All PM links resolve; docs render; no broken references in `AI_first/ui/PM.html`.
- **Rollback:** Revert directory moves and link updates if consolidation fails.
- **Ready checklist:** Phase 03 files exist; target directory defined.
- **Done checklist:** Consolidation completed; links verified; documentation updated.
