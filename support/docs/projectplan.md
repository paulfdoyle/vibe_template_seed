- Project-wide actions: add under `support/docs/project_wide_actions/` if needed (not included by default).

## Governance
- Follow `support/docs/process.md` and personas in `support/docs/project_wide_docs/personas.md`.
- Use templates under `support/docs/templates/` for new project/phase/stage docs.
