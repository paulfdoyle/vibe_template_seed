# Project Plan (Template)

## Project objective and scope
- Provide a neutral, reusable template with standard process, personas, optional BugMgmt module, basic UI template, and a sample project to onboard new teams quickly.

## Projects
- **sample_project (planning)**
  - Summary: `DOCS/projects/sample_project/project_summary_sample.md`
  - Phases root: `DOCS/projects/sample_project/phases/`
  - Issues log: (optional; use BugMgmt module)
  - Phases overview:
    - Phase 01 — Sample setup (planning): see `DOCS/projects/sample_project/phases/phase01/`.
  - Phase directory map:
    - `DOCS/projects/sample_project/phases/phase01/phase_definition.md` — definition of Phase 01.
    - `DOCS/projects/sample_project/phases/phase01/action_plan_phase01.md` — action plan for Phase 01 (links to stage actions under `DOCS/projects/sample_project/phases/phase01/actions/`).

## Project-wide references and actions
- Personas: `DOCS/project_wide_docs/personas.md`.
- Templates: `DOCS/templates/` (project plan, phase definition/action plan, stage action, review checklists, DoD).
- Project-wide actions: add under `DOCS/project_wide_actions/` if needed (not included by default).

## Governance
- Follow `DOCS/process.md` and personas in `DOCS/project_wide_docs/personas.md`.
- Use templates under `DOCS/templates/` for new project/phase/stage docs.
